# SimSiam-LiverCancer-CL
 This repo hosts code for our study on liver cancer classification using CT scans. We leverage SimSiam, a self-supervised learning model, with CNN classifiers. Two loss functions, MSE and COS, are employed. Our dataset comprises 460 patients with diverse liver cancers. Results indicate improved accuracies for all models.
